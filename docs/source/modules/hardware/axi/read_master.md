# AXI Read Master

The AXI read master is responsible to drive the AR (Read Address) and R (Read Data) channels in the AXI interface according to a user request. The upstream component defines the desired start address and byte count through a valid-ready request interface. The Read Master uses burst functionality to fetch the required data with the minimum number of AXI transactions. As such, the required beat count is dynamically determined, and the AXI fields are driven appropriately. As defined by the AXI Protocol, a single transaction cannot cross a 4kB boundary, so in this event, the Read Master partitions the request into the required number of transactions before cycling through its internal state machine. Finally, the response beats are passed through to the downstream logic through a valid-ready response interface.

    "When we import a pretrained transformer model from HuggingFace, we receive the encoder/decoder weights, which aren't that useful on their own - to perform a useful task such as sequence classification, we add a classification head on top of the model and train those weights on the required dataset. In this tutorial, we'll look at fine tuning a Bert model for sequence classification with two approaches. First, we'll attempt full Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and see how this is infeasible without specialized hardware. Then, we'll use the Mase stack to add a [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) adapter to the model. \n",

In the end, I thought it was great.<br /><br />An interesting storyline, good characters, a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch. This was, in fact, the first I'd heard of this movie, but I would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema.<br /><br />My IMDB Rating : 8 out of 10<br /><br />\n",

    "Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size and complexity of neural networks by removing unnecessary parameters (weights and connections) or structural components (neurons, filters, or layers). The goal is to create a smaller, more efficient model that maintains most of the original model's performance. The following benefits can be seen from pruning neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduce model size**: Deep neural networks often have millions of parameters, leading to large storage requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decrease inference time**: Fewer parameters mean fewer computations, resulting in faster predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve generalization**: Removing unnecessary connections can help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy efficiency**: Smaller models require less energy to run, which is crucial for edge devices and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured pruning removes entire structures (e.g., channels, filters, or layers) from the network, while unstructured pruning removes individual weights or connections from the network, regardless of their location. In this tutorial, we'll build on top of Tutorial 3 by taking the quantized Bert model and running Mase's unstructured pruning pass. After pruning, we'll run further fine tuning iterations to retain sequence classification accuracy in the pruned model."

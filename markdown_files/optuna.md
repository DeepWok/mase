# Optimization Procedure with Optuna

This section outlines the implementation details of our optimization procedure, leveraging the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework. Our approach involves evaluating neural network (NN) architectures based on zero-cost proxies, aiming to identify efficient architectures without extensive computational resources.

## Overview

The provided `optuna.py` script integrates the Optuna framework within our search strategy, extending a base class `SearchStrategyBase`. The script focuses on setting up the optimization environment, defining the objective function, and conducting the search with callbacks for saving and logging progress.

### Key Components

- **Callback Function for Saving Studies**: Implements a mechanism to save the state of the Optuna study periodically, ensuring that progress is not lost and can be resumed or analyzed later.
- **SearchStrategyOptuna Class**: Defines the core search strategy, integrating Optuna samplers for sampling the hyperparameter space and conducting the optimization process.

## Detailed Implementation

### Configuration and Initialization

The search strategy initializes by extracting key information from a configuration file, setting up the search space, and determining whether zero-cost search mode is enabled.

### Sampler Mapping

A method `sampler_map` maps sampler names to Optuna's sampler objects, enabling the selection of different sampling strategies like random sampling, TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator), NSGA-II, etc.

### Objective Function

The `objective` method is the heart of the optimization process, defining how the fitness of each NN architecture is evaluated. It includes support for zero-cost mode, where architectures are evaluated based on zero-cost proxies rather than full training cycles.

### Search Execution

The `search` method orchestrates the optimization process, creating an Optuna study, executing the optimization, and applying callbacks for periodic saving. It also handles the loading of studies from checkpoints to resume the optimization process.

### Zero-Cost Weight Calculation

An additional method, `zero_cost_weight`, calculates the weights for zero-cost proxies based on their correlation with true performance metrics, leveraging linear regression for this purpose.

## Conclusion

The `optuna.py` script represents a sophisticated integration of the Optuna optimization framework with our zero-cost proxy evaluation strategy. By leveraging Optuna's capabilities and extending them with specific functionalities like zero-cost mode and callback mechanisms for saving progress, we enhance our ability to efficiently evaluate and optimize NN architectures.

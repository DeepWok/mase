# Rebuilding Architecture in MASE

The process of rebuilding architectures in MASE, particularly within the context of zero-cost NAS, is a critical component of the architecture optimization pipeline. This document elaborates on the methodology and technical details involved in this process.

## Overview

The `rebuild_model` method in the `ZeroCostProxy` class is responsible for dynamically reconstructing neural network models based on sampled configurations. This method leverages architecture data from NAS-Bench-201, enabling the evaluation of performance without the need for extensive computational resources.

## Architecture Reconstruction in Detail

The process of architecture reconstruction in our project follows a systematic approach designed to efficiently leverage the extensive neural network configurations provided by NAS-Bench-201. Below are the steps involved in this process:

### Configuration Sampling

- **Step Description**: Begin with the sampling of architecture configurations, where specific components and parameters are selected to define the neural network's structure.
- **Purpose**: This step determines the blueprint for the neural network model to be reconstructed based on selected traits such as layer sizes or operation types.

### Querying NAS-Bench-201

- **Step Description**: Utilize the defined configuration to query the NAS-Bench-201 API, retrieving performance data for architectures that align with the chosen setup.
- **Utility**: NAS-Bench-201's database acts as a pivotal resource, providing empirical data on 15,625 neural architectures, aiding in the informed selection of promising models.

### Architecture Reconstruction

- **Step Description**: Employ the data retrieved from NAS-Bench-201 to reconstruct the neural network model, adhering to the specified configuration details.
- **Process**: This involves reconstructing the model to reflect the specific arrangement of cells and operations between nodes as dictated by the benchmark's standards.

### Mode Setting

- **Step Description**: Configure the operational state of the reconstructed model to either evaluation mode for performance assessment or training mode for further parameter tuning.
- **Objective**: Tailoring the modelâ€™s mode to the analysis or optimization task at hand enhances the relevancy and efficacy of subsequent evaluations or improvements.

## Technical Details

- **Dynamic Reconstruction Process**: This approach facilitates the exploration of a wide array of architecture configurations, supporting diverse neural network designs.
- **Utilization of NAS-Bench-201 API**: Key to speeding up the optimization cycle, the API access enables quick retrieval of detailed architecture performance data.
- **Compatibility with MASE Framework**: Ensures that reconstructed models can be seamlessly integrated into the broader architecture search and evaluation pipeline, bolstering the project's methodological consistency.

## Conclusion

Rebuilding architectures in MASE is a foundational step in the zero-cost NAS strategy, enabling the rapid evaluation of neural network models. By efficiently leveraging NAS-Bench-201 data, the process facilitates the exploration of optimal architectures, contributing significantly to the field of neural network optimization.

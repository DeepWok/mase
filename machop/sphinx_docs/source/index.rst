`Machop <https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Machop_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>`_
is a humanoid, bipedal Pokémon that has blue-gray skin. 
It has three brown ridges on top of its head, 
large red eyes, and a relatively flat face. 
On either side of its chest are three, thin, rib-like stripes. 
Its feet appear to have no toes, while its hands have five fingers. Machop also has a short, stubby tail.

Why called Machop? Because Machop is the most common pokemon you can find in the 
`Final Maze <https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Final_Maze>`_!

# Rebuilding Architecture in MASE

The process of rebuilding architectures in MASE, particularly within the context of zero-cost NAS, is a critical component of the architecture optimization pipeline. This document elaborates on the methodology and technical details involved in this process.

## Overview

The `rebuild_model` method in the `ZeroCostProxy` class is responsible for dynamically reconstructing neural network models based on sampled configurations. This method leverages architecture data from NAS-Bench-201, enabling the evaluation of performance without the need for extensive computational resources.

## Methodology

1. **Configuration Sampling**: The method begins by sampling a configuration, which specifies the architecture components and parameters to be included in the rebuilt model.
2. **Querying NAS-Bench-201**: Based on the sampled configuration, the method queries the NAS-Bench-201 API for the performance data of the corresponding architecture. This step is crucial for understanding the potential effectiveness of the architecture.
3. **Architecture Reconstruction**: Utilizing the information retrieved from NAS-Bench-201, the method reconstructs the neural network model. This reconstructed model is then used for further evaluation and analysis.
4. **Mode Setting**: The rebuilt model can be set to either evaluation mode or training mode, depending on the requirements of the subsequent analysis or optimization steps.

## Technical Details

- The reconstruction process is highly dynamic, allowing for the exploration of a wide range of architecture configurations.
- The use of NAS-Bench-201 API facilitates access to a vast database of pre-evaluated architectures, significantly speeding up the optimization process.
- The reconstructed models are fully compatible with the MASE framework, enabling seamless integration into the broader architecture search and evaluation pipeline.

## Conclusion

Rebuilding architectures in MASE is a foundational step in the zero-cost NAS strategy, enabling the rapid evaluation of neural network models. By efficiently leveraging NAS-Bench-201 data, the process facilitates the exploration of optimal architectures, contributing significantly to the field of neural network optimization.

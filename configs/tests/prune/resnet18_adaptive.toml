# NOTE: Take a look at pruning/methods.py and pruning/criteria.py for available values
# This config shows an example weight pruning pass (L1 norm - 10% sparsity) with the
# activation pruning add-on (adaptive strategy). This strategy computes thresholds on
# the fly and the target specified is the desired sparsity in the activations.
